# QAPFL Health Monitor Platform

## Non-Invasive Continuous Health Monitor with Federated Learning

**Quality-Aware Personalized Federated Learning (QAPFL) for Multimodal Wearable Health Monitoring**

> ⚠️ **MEDICAL DISCLAIMER**: This software is an engineering research prototype. It is NOT intended for medical diagnosis, treatment, or emergency decision-making. All outputs are research results only.

Current centralized release: [`docs/CENTRALIZED_SYSTEM_V2.md`](docs/CENTRALIZED_SYSTEM_V2.md).
It serves the locked ECG model, non-circular PPG pulse estimation, measured
SpO2 validation, and quality-gated integration. The older learned BIDMC fusion
is retained only as research history after its target-validity audit.

---

## Project Overview

This platform is a final-year engineering research prototype implementing:

- **Real-time physiological signal monitoring** (ECG, PPG, HR, SpO₂)
- **Signal Quality Index (SQI) assessment** with quality-aware confidence
- **Anomaly detection** using Isolation Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM Autoencoder
- **Personalized baseline learning** per user
- **Federated Learning** with FedAvg, Personalized FL, and the proposed **QAPFL**
- **Research experiment framework** (noise robustness, ablation study, model comparison)
- **Professional React dashboard** with 33+ pages

### Research Novelty: QAPFL

Standard FedAvg treats all clients equally. QAPFL weights each client's contribution by:

```
quality_score_i = α·SQI_i + β·data_quality_i + γ·local_F1_i + δ·(1-uncertainty_i)
weight_i        = softmax(quality_score_i)
```

Where α, β, γ, δ are configurable weights. Clients with poor signal quality, missing data, low local performance, or high uncertainty contribute less to the global model, making the system robust to noisy/unreliable clients.

## QAPFL Algorithm Details

See [`docs/qapfl_algorithm.md`](docs/qapfl_algorithm.md) for the complete mathematical formulation.

**Configurable weights** (via `.env` or Settings page):
```
QAPFL_ALPHA=0.35  # Signal quality weight
QAPFL_BETA=0.25   # Data quality weight
QAPFL_GAMMA=0.30  # Model performance weight
QAPFL_DELTA=0.10  # Uncertainty penalty weight
```

All weights must sum to 1.0. The server auto-normalizes if they don't.

## ESP32 Integration

To use with real hardware (ESP32 + MAX30102 + AD8232):

1. Flash ESP32 with provided BLE firmware (see [`docs/esp32_integration.md`](docs/esp32_integration.md))
2. The BLE adapter automatically handles the packet format
3. Replace simulator calls with real BLE connection in `monitoring_service.py`

**BLE Packet Format:**
```
[0x55 0xAA]  Header (2 bytes)
[seq(4)]     Sequence number
[hr(2)]      Heart rate × 10 (e.g., 740 = 74.0 BPM)
[spo2(2)]    SpO₂ × 100 (e.g., 9820 = 98.20%)
[n_ecg(2)]   Number of ECG samples
[ecg×n(2n)]  ECG samples (int16, µV)
[n_ppg(2)]   Number of PPG samples  
[ppg×n(2n)]  PPG samples (int16)
[battery(1)] Battery % (0-100)
[chk(2)]     CRC16 checksum
```

## Configuration

Key settings in `.env`:

```bash
# Anomaly Detection
ANOMALY_THRESHOLD=0.5        # Score threshold for anomaly classification
SQI_THRESHOLD=60.0           # Minimum SQI for high-confidence anomaly
CONFIDENCE_MIN_SQI=40.0      # Minimum SQI to report any confidence

# Federated Learning
FL_ROUNDS=10                 # Training rounds per experiment
FL_LOCAL_EPOCHS=5            # Local epochs per client per round
FL_LEARNING_RATE=0.001       # Local optimizer learning rate
FL_MIN_CLIENTS=3             # Minimum clients to start a round
FL_PERSONALIZATION_ALPHA=0.3 # Personalization mixing coefficient

# QAPFL Weights (must sum to 1.0)
QAPFL_ALPHA=0.35             # Signal quality weight
QAPFL_BETA=0.25              # Data quality weight
QAPFL_GAMMA=0.30             # Model performance weight
QAPFL_DELTA=0.10             # Uncertainty penalty weight
```

All parameters can also be changed via the Settings page in the dashboard.

## Limitations

1. **Synthetic data only**: All physiological data is mathematically generated. Results are for algorithm validation, not clinical performance claims.
2. **In-process FL simulation**: FL uses in-process simulation, not real network communication. Communication costs are estimated based on model size.
3. **LSTM Autoencoder**: The LSTM model uses simulated training due to synthetic data. In a real deployment, it would be trained on actual physiological recordings.
4. **No real cryptography**: FL updates use simulated transmission. Production would require TLS and optionally differential privacy.
5. **Not a medical device**: This system has NOT been validated for clinical use and must not be used for healthcare decisions.
